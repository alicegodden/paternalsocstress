Zebrafish UTR sequences were accessed from TargetScan Fish

Mature miRNA sequences fasta file accessed from miRbase- 
https://www.mirbase.org/download/

To filter out the Zebrafish mature miRNAs:
grep -A 1 "^>dre" mature.fasta | grep -v "^--$" > dre.mature.fasta 

To isolate the miRNA sequences of interest:
# Loop through each miRNA name in mirna_list.txt
while IFS= read -r mirna; do
    # Use grep to find the miRNA and the line immediately following it
    grep -A 1 "$mirna" dre.mature.fasta
done < mirna_list.txt | grep -v "^--$" > dre.mature.fasta


Reference genome and gff3 annotation accessed from Ensembl v107:
https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-107/fasta/danio_rerio/ 

Converted UTRs to fasta format: 
bedtools getfasta -fi Danio_rerio.GRCz11.dna.primary_assembly.fa -bed GRCz11.107.UTRs.gff3 -s -tab |paste <(cut -f 9 GRCz11.107.UTRs.gff3|sed 's/Parent=transcript://g' ) - |awk 'length($3)>10' |cut -f 1,3 |sed 's/\t/#/1' |sed 's/^/>/g' |tr "#" "\n " >NamedUTRs.fasta

To annotate the UTRs:
awk '$3=="three_prime_UTR"' Danio_rerio.GRCz11.107.gff3 >GRCz11.107.UTRs.gff3 

miRanda 3.3a was installed in a conda environment from:
https://anaconda.org/bioconda/miranda

ran as batch job:
module load python/anaconda/2019.10/3.7
source activate miranda
miranda test.fasta NamedUTRs.fasta > miranda.results.output

Filtered MiRanda output for highest scores
cat *.output |grep ">>" |sort -k5,5nr |sed 's/>>//g' |cat <(echo "Seq1,Seq2,Tot Score,Tot Energy,Max Score,Max Energy,Strand,Len1,Len2,Positions" |tr "," "\t") - >MirandaOutput.tab

Python scripts for plotting and filtering:
1. filter_miranda_output.py # Took miRanda output column 2 with transcript ids, and used this to match to our list of significantly differentially expressed gene ids. Used biomart for gene id to transcript id conversions.
2. match_and_append.py # To add biomart information to matched outputs
3. barchart.py # Plotting number of targeted genes and miRNAs in our datasets. Used - cut -f 12 yourfile.txt | sort | uniq | wc -l to find number of genes targeted by miRNA of interest. 
4. matching_raw_rna.py # To match rnaseq raw counts matrix rows to the gene id's targeted by our miRNAs of interest
